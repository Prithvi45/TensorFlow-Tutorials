Line Regression

y = ax + b

we will find best a and v values

how to calculate error?
how to minimize error?
Gradient descent


Logistic Regression
dependent variable
e.g  number of students passing the exam based on number of hours spent in exam hall
the pass or fail is dependent varaible and represented by 0 & 1

x axis -> no of hours
y axis -> no of marks

in logistic Reg we will get only two outcomes

f(y) = pass or fail 
output is dependent on two independent of variables
